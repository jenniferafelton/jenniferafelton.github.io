### Projects

[Halloween Pumpkin Punter](https://jenniferafelton.github.io/Pumpkin_Punter/)<br><br>
Pumpkin Punter is based upon a group project from IESD. The goal is to reach all the tombstones while kicking pumpkins out of the way. I learned to create assets with actions and to create a custom first person camera that interacts with the environment. <br> <br>
