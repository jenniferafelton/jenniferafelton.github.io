### Projects

[Tuffy Track](https://jenniferafelton.github.io/TuffyTrack/)<br><br>
TuffyTrack is a group project I worked on for Spring 2020 Software Development with Open Source class at California State Fullerton. The requirements were for a group of 2-3 students to make a project using Open Source Software, using existing Open Source software and code written by our group. It must use CASE tools, version control software, and include documentation.   <br> <br>

[Halloween Pumpkin Punter](https://jenniferafelton.github.io/Pumpkin_Punter/)<br><br>
Pumpkin Punter is based upon a group project from IESD. The goal is to reach all the tombstones while kicking pumpkins out of the way. I learned to create assets with actions and to create a custom first person camera that interacts with the environment. <br> <br>
